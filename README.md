 _Tourism website_
 
 The sites on tourism invade the web, each hotel, restaurant and tourist attraction has its own website. Tourism is very profitable, especially with the diversity of monetization techniques. The creation of a website on tourism involves in-depth research of the competition, but also of the approach on the content strategy and the services that we want to offer. Basically, you can create two main tourism sites, one that focuses on content with articles that describe attractions, accommodation and food. And we have the one that offers online reservations on airline tickets and hotels.
 
 
**Before you start coding**

As good work comes from good preparation, here are some steps to follow before dipping your hands in the sludge:

- Create a public repo named "npProject"
- Define your project
- Site model (s)
- Graphic charter (do not push the exercise too far but define the basics: colors / typography / different recurring elements (navBar, aside, footer ...))
- Data details (define the elements that will be loaded from your database (dynamic) and those that will be fixed on your site (purely static HTML)
- Database schema
- Everything you need to start developing your project calmly All these elements should be found as quickly as possible in the project's Readme


**To find in your project**

- A session system: registration, connection / disconnection / lost password / various privileges
- User interactions consistent with the chosen site theme (ex: comments, forum, chat, registration and sale of tickets for the event with confirmation by email, newsletter, interactive maps, e-shop, chatbot .....)
- The use of at least one API
